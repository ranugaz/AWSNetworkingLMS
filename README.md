# Project Structure

This structure provides a foundation for your GitHub project, including a system specification and placeholders for C4 architectural diagrams. 

To complete the project setup:

    Created a new repository on GitHub named "AWSNetworkingLP".
    Initialized it with a README.md file containing the content provided above.
    Created two additional files: SPECIFICATION.md and ARCHITECTURE.md.
    For the C4 diagrams, I've use tools Mermaid tool to create the diagrams and then insert the code into the ARCHITECTURE.md file.

This project structure provides a clear structure for developing an AWS Networking Learning Plartform, with room for expansion and refinement as I progress.
